  </div>

  <div class="Para bPara">
    <h3>Why Bother</h3>
    <p>As you can see our old bathroom was in very good nick 
       despite its age (44 years). I must admit I like the color scheme,
       the bidet and nicely moulded bath cum shower enclosure.
       All my kids enjoyed the bath tub part when they were toddlers.
       And it was so easy to keep it clean.
    </p>
    <p>With all our friends having progressed to owning large and new
       homes, there was pressure from my wife Padma to upgrade 
       every thing if we were not moving ever :( . I staved off this
       pressure for a while. But with my autistic son Kiran growing up
       to be a man and  my mum moving in with us after dad passed
       away, I had to give in for the reasons of improved accessibility.
    </p>
       
  </div>

    <div class="Para bPara">
    <h3>Thwarted Attempts</h3>
      Knowing how I turn everything into a major project,
      Padma was adamant that the job be outsourced. With my
      finger in the pie, her attempt to engage disability services
      as well as an independent contractor to do the job was
      unsuccessful. The disability services proposals were 
      restrictive due to regulations. They were proposing to 
      change things that were not needed and refusing to adapt to our needs.
      The private contractor's (unlicensed)
      quote was pricey  (~$14k excluding fixtures and material)
      When I showed him my spread sheet estimating labor 
      costs that are half as much, he wasn't too impressed. 
      <p> Finally Padma give up and reluctantly agreed for me 
      take up the job. By now, we spent
      a lot of time exploring designs and fixtures  but
      haven't consolidated them. </p>

       <h3>Demolition Derby</h3>
       While I was keen on keeping the bidet for Kiran's care needs.
       Padma was hell bent on getting rid of it. And I finally yielded.
       In the end it did turn out to be the right decision from aesthetics
       point of view.
       We started off with the easy part of removing the wall tiles.
       Most of the tiles came off intact. Sadly such tiles are no longer
       in vogue. I felt  sad  sending them to the tip. 
       As for the vanity, we decided to reuse it as a
       storage unit in our tool shed.
       Back of the vanity unit is nailed to the studs, and needed careful
       prying off with crowbar without damaging the plaster walls.

    <div class="Para bPara"> 
    Removing floor tiles proved very challenging, especially
    without appropriate power tool. In the past, 
    builders used to cement tiles over a wire mesh that is nailed
    to the subfloor with a waterproof membrane underneath it.
    It is a solid construct and the tiles have
    not moved all these years. Removing the tiles and the cement layer
    is indeed tough. Instead, lifting the cemment layer along with the
    mesh is a better option. But it requires some brute strenth, while
    making sure the subfloor is not damaged.
    Used a crow bar to hammer my way through. It took few days to complete the job.
    Not a job for faint hearted and it would be very noisy.

      Time to tackle the bath and shower enclosure. It took a while to figure
      out the safe way to do it. Had to go up the ceiling
      to see if the side wall separating the bath enclousure
      is weight bearing. And it was relief that it was not.
      I really wanted this bath enclosure
      be taken out in one piece if I could, for it is such
      a nice piece. Alas, it was not possible unless I removed
      the window to get it out of the bathroom.  The tub material
      is reinforced fiber glass with PVC overlay. Extremely hardy
      and difficult to cut without an oscillating
      hand saw. I opted for the  angle grinder to make cuts.
      It created so much dust that I regret it. Cutting down the 
      enclosure into pieces
      had to be done with great care to avoid damaging studs and
      any electrical wiring behind it.

      The last phase of the shower enclousre removal was to detach it
      from the stud wall fixing. It took a while to cut through
      the plastic with a multi-tool. As I removed the plastic
      part, I could see the cut went past the plastic layer and 
      into supporting wood. I was scared that I had cut into
      the stud. But was relieved finding that it was the lapping timber nailed
      to a stud and it is not part of support structure.

      For those technically minded, you can see how the
      shower enclosure and bath tub walls were made. They were made
      from reinforced
      fiberglass layer sandwiched between plastic and a corrugated
      fibreglass layer.

  <div class="Para bPara"> 
      The shower enclosure is now completely removed. Notice the crumbled
      cement bed on which the base of the shower enclosure  was sitting on.
      This is to allow
      for movements in the floor, without effecting the tub level (I think).
      Most of the bath tub part is heavily reinforced both with fibre glass
      and stell plate at the bottom.

    It is time to prep the sub floor to lay the tile tray
    for my shower floor. I purchased this tile tray because it 
    comes with  prebuilt slope, is durable and water tight. But it requires
    to be set on joists so that the shower tray lip will be flush
    with the surrounding floor tiles. The process involves
       <ul><li> Cutting the sub floor </li>
	   <li> Adding additional joists to support the tray </li>
	   <li> Setting the tray in with glue ensureing that it is dead level </li>

    Before cutting the subfloor with the circular saw, 
    made sure that  no wiring or piping runs were in the way.
    Despite all precautions, I did hit one nail in the tongue
    and grove flooring. But luckily I stopped short before damaging
    the blade. Perhaps, I should have used a magnet to locate the
    nails before the cut.

    <div class="caption ">Adding Joists  </div>

  <div class="Para bPara">
    Adding the joists proved very tricky. Since they have to 
    go under the sub floor, there was not much room to rotate the wood
    into place. I had to shave off ends to rotate and anchorr them over the bearers.
    Fixing the joists required nailing because they are tough 
    and hold better under twisting loads.
    Also, I found that it is very hard to drive screws
    through old hardwood. Application of wax and
    predrilling made the nailing job lot easier. Nailing in tight spaces was 
    still a problem for me. Ended up using screws in those instances.

    <p> I had to make sure the joists are level for
    the tray to sit on. Any slope will compromise shower water drainage
    This however proved a daunting task for me even with the assitance
    of laser leveler. I almost lost one week
    mucking around. Despite all efforts the leveling was not so good
    in acros the drain location. It was out by 0.5 degree.

      The shower tile tray is in place. Ideally the tray should have been
      checked into the studs by 10mm so that after laying cement sheet, the
      tiled wall bootom edges end up inside the tray. But I did not do
      it based on the advice from tray supplier. This required me at
      later stage to use water barrier tape to stop water getting
      behind the tray when it flows over the tiled wall. You will see the
      sealing tape in one of the pictures that follow.

    Before gluing the tray, had to complete the plumbing fixtures
    as I would lose ease of access to the piping under the hose.
    Deciding between the  compression fittings
    or new generation snap in PVC fittings for plumbing was difficult with
    conflicting opinions. Decided
    to go with proven copper piping and compression fittings that
    required no soldering or special tools. Using a pipe
    bender made the task very neat and satisfying. I was proud of my work despite
    the fact I took few days to do it.
    <p> Installing mixer valve body  needed special attention because it should be 
    installed before cement sheet and tiling is done. This requires
    mounting the mixer with the right offset from the fully tiled wall to 
    ensure the mixer tap fits in properly after tiling. This kept me
    awake until the mixer tap is fully installed, because
    an incorrect offset in valve seat will for certain require 
    ripping and re-installation of entire tiled wall. :((

  <div class="bgPic" id="img38"> 
    <div class="caption ">Shower walls prep </div>

  <div class="Para bPara">
      I chose to lay water resistant cement sheets
      all around the bathroom up to two meters height. Had to use
      almost 300 screws. I must say my drill has never worked
      harder :)). The but joints of cement sheets are sealed off
      with special cement. The most brain racking task 
      was working out the optimal way to cut the sheets while they
      fit neatly across the studs so that they can be screwed on.
      Normally tradies use large sheets making the job lot easer,
      but it requies some helping hands as they are heavy.
      <p>
      When laying the sheets one has to make sure the walls are smooth
      with no ondulations (no more than 1 to 2mm). For an old house
      like mine normally it would require some shimming or shaving of
      studs to
      achieve it. Despite the age of the house, it appeared from my 
      measurements the walls were quite square and smooth with 2 to
      3mm variations from smooth plane and I thought I can get away
      with no major adjustments.
      But  come tiling, I could see how important it is it make the walls
      very flat, unless we are professional tilers. In few spots I could
      not aovid having lippage (~1mm) despite the use of leveling clips.
      </p>
      Notice the light blue strip all along the bottom of the shower and
      along the corner where the shower walls meet. This is the special 
      bituman tape I mentioned earlier that will act as water seal 
      at the bottom seam where shower tray lip meets the cement sheet.

   The standard requires that all wet areas are covered with
   water proofing membrane (preferably by an expert !!). However, I found
   that it  was a
   breeze to apply the waterproofing layer. Anyone can with a brush can do it.
   Just have to make sure 
   all joints and gaps are covered well. I applied three quotes since I had
   lots of the stuff.  After the treatment the bathroom looked so good. The blue color was
   very calming effect. It will ofcourse be not visible once you tile over it.

    This was really a mental exercise. One need to plan ahead how you
    would lay the tiles especially when have to tile around the tray,
    and the room is not that square. Being me, I used rendering tools
    to actually lay the tiles in software and then see how it looks before
    deciding to lay them. The simulation engine I used is called "povray"
    One can take image of the tile to be layed and see how the bathroom
    looks before deciding on the tile size and designs.
    <p>
    Apart from painstaking arrangement of tiles to achieve a good pattern,
    handling and cutting
    heavy porcealin tiles proved very labour intensive. Thanks to Padma who
    helped with mixing the glue,  keeping time and scheduling the tasks
    I managed to finish tiling in three weeks. It is fairly excessive time
    by any standards, but this mainly due to our choice of portable tile cutter
    that required 

    It is too long a time,
    cutting. This is because we chose a very portable tile cutter that 
    is relatively easy and allowed us to do tiling at our own pace without
    incuring rental costs.

    It became clear a suction handle
    is needed to position the tile while laying it. The strong surface tension 
    due to large surface makes it hard to maneuver it with bare hands without proper 
    grip.  Luckily my mum's shower handle came to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
    The tile cutter I chose was easy to use (made by Makita), battery operated
    and very portable. But  it takes long time to make long and deep cuts that
    require several passes. But being a wet cutter there is no issue with 
    dust generation.
    The tool comes with two battery packs that are comact
    and they last long enough and charge fast.
    The porcelain tile does use up the diamonod discs 
    quickly. I had to buy additional discs to complete the job.

    Planning and making waste connections kept me really awake. It
