</div>

<div class="Para bPara">
  <h3>Why Bother</h3>
  <p>As you can see our main bathroom is in very good nick 
     despite its age (44 years). I must admit I like the color scheme,
     the bidet and nicely moulded bath cum shower enclosure.
     All my kids enjoyed the bath tub part when they were toddlers.
     And it is so easy to keep it clean.
  </p>
  <p>With all our friends having progressed to owning large and new
     homes there is some pressure from my wife Padma to upgrade 
     everything if we are not moving out ever ;). I staved off this
     pressure for a while. But with my autistic son Kiran growing up
     to be a man and with my mum moving in with us after my dad passed
     away, I had to give in  for the reasons of accessibility.
  </p>

  <div class="Para bPara">
  <h3>Thwarted Attempts</h3>
    Knowing how I turn everything into a major project,
    Padma was adamant that the job be outsourced. With my
    finger in the pie, her attempt to engage disability services
    as well as an independent contractor to do the job was
    not successful. The disability services proposals were 
    restrictive due to regulations. They were proposing to 
    change things that are needed and refusing to adapt to our needs.
    The private contractor (unlicensed)
    quote was pricey  ($14k excluding fixtures and material)
    When I presented him with spreadsheet of estimating labor 
    and associated costs that showed it should be half as much
    he wasn't too impressed. 
    <p> Finally Padma had given up, and very reluctantly agreed that I could
    take up the job. By this time we spent
    a lot of time in homing on all fixtures and design but
    haven't consolidated it. </p>

     <h3>Demolition Derby</h3>
     First we started off with the easy part. Removing the wall tiles
     and it wasn't much of an effort. Although we took most of the tiles
     off intact, it is a pity that such tiles are no  more in vogue. It
     was painful to relegate them to tip. Instead of smashing the vanity 
     we decided to take it out intact with the intent to use it as a
     storage unit in our tool shed.
     <p>
     Back of the vanity unit is nailed to the studs, and needed careful
     prying off without damaging the plaster walls.

  <div class="Para bPara"> 
  Removing floor tiles is very challenging, especially
  if you don't have power tools. That aside, the way
  of laying tiles on the timber floor, is to lay wire
  mesh over a water proof membrane, and then cement the
  tiles over it. It is so solid that not a single tile
  moved in all these years. Used a crow bar to
   hammer my way through. It took few days to complete the job.
  Not a job for faint  and is very noisy.

     <h3>Throwing the baby</h3>
    Time to tackle the bath tub. It took a while to figure
    out the safe way to do it. Had to go up the ceiling
    to see if the side wall is weight bearing or just
    a separator for bath tub. I really wanted this tub to
    be taken apart in one piece if I could for it is such
    a nice piece. Alas, it is not possible. The tub material
    is reinforced fiber glass with PVC overlay. Extremely hardy
    not so easy to cut unless you have one of those oscillating
    hand saw. I chose the angle grinder path which I regret now.
    It created so much dust. Cutting down the tube into pieces
    had to be done with great care without cutting off the studs
    behind it, and avoiding any electrical wiring.

     <h3>OOPS</h3>
    The last phase of the bath tub removal was to detach it
    from the stud wall fixing. It took a while to cut through
    the plastic with the multi-tool. As I removed the plastic
    part, I cut see the cut went much deeper than the plastic
    going into wood. It gave me a real scare that I have cut into
    the stud. But later it is just another lapping timer frame nailed
    to the stud. I was so relieved.

<div class="Para bPara"> 
    The shower enclosure is now fully removed. Notice the crumbled

    for movements in the floor, without effecting the tub level (I think).

  It is time to prep the sub floor to lay the tile tray
  for my shower base. I purchased this tile tray for it 
  has prebuilt slope and is very durable. But it requires
  to be set on joists so that the shower base will be flush
  with tiles. The process involves
     <ul><li> Curt the sub floor </li>
         <li> Add additional joists to support tray </li>
	 <li> Set the tray in with glue </li>

  When cutting with the circular saw it is important to keep
  the depth of the plunge close to timber thickness. Also,
  make sure you have no wiring or piping runs that can get in the
  way.

<div class="bgPic" id="img30"> 
  <div class="caption ">Adding Joists  </div>
</div>

<div class="Para bPara">
  Adding the joists proved very tricky. Since they have to 
  go under the sub floor there is not much room to rotate the wood
  into place and need to shave off ends to attach them to the bearers.
  This job required nailing for it is very hard to drive screws
  through old hardwood. Nailing with predrilling and application of
  wax to nails proved to be most efficient. Nailing in tight spaces is
  for professionals. I ended up using screws in those instances.

  <p> I had to make sure the joists provide a leveled plane for
  the tray to sit on. Any slope will compromise shower water drainage
  This however proved a daunting task for me. I almost lost one week
  mucking around. Despite all my efforts the leveling was not so perfect
  in lateral direction. It was out by 0.5 degree.

<div class="bgPic" id="img26"> 
  <div class="caption ">Shower Tile Tray  </div>
</div>
<div class="Para bPara">
    The shower tile tray is in place. Ideally the tray should have been
    checked into the studs so that after cement sheet and tiles 
    were laid the tiles end up inside the tray. But I did not do
    it based on the advice from tray supplier. This required me at
    later stage to use water barrier tape. You can see the detail in 
    next few slides.

  Planning and deciding on whether to use compression fittings
  or to use new generation snap in PVC fittings was fun. Decided
  to go the copper piping and compression fittings. Using pipe
  bender made the task very neat. I was proud of my work despite
  the fact I took few days to do it.
  <p> One important detail is in making sure the mixer valve fittings
  are offset from the wall to right depth. Failing to do so will 
  give you grief when trying to fix the taps after tiling. You 
  literally have to rip the tiling if you muck up.

<div class="bgPic" id="img38"> 
  <div class="caption ">Shower walls prep </div>

<div class="Para bPara">
    I have chosen to lay water resistant cement sheets
    all around the bathroom up to two meters. Had to use
    almost 300 screws. I must say my drill has never worked
    harder :)). The joining seams of sheets are sealed off
    with special cement. The most brain racking task for me here
    was working out the optimal way to cut the sheets while they
    fit neatly across the studs so that they can be screwed on.
    Normally trades use large sheets as they have helping hand
    and handle big sheets. But I chose smaller sheets.
    <p>
    When laying the sheets one has to make sure the walls are smooth
    with no ondulations (no more than 1 to 2mm). For a old house
    like mine normally it would require some shimming or shaving to
    achieve it. But I did not have to do it. It was not perfect but
    passable so I thought. But trust me come tiling, especially
    when large tiles are used you will suffer if you don't make walls
    nice and level.
    </p>
    Notice the light blue strip all along the bottom of the shower and
    along the corner where the shower walls meet. This is special 
    bituman tape I mentioned earlier that will act a water seal 
    at the seams.

<div class="bgPic" id="img39"> 
  <div class="caption ">Water Proofing </div>
</div>
<div class="Para bPara">
 The standard requires that all wet areas are waterproofed by
 water proofing membrane (preferably by expert !!). It was a
 breeze. Anyone can with brush can do it. Just make sure you cover
 everything. Give two to thee coats. Buy good stuff though.
 After the treatment the bathroom looked so good. The blue color was
 very pleasing.

<div class="Para bPara">
  This was really a mental exercise. One need to plan ahead how you
  would lay the tiles especially when have to tile around the tray,
  and the room is not that square. Being me, I used rendering tools
  to actually lay the tiles in software and then see how it looks before
  deciding to lay them. The simulation engine I used is called "povray"
  One can take image of the tile you intend to lay and see how the bathroom
  looks before deciding on the tile color design etc. 
  <p>
  Apart from planning, cutting the hard porcelain tiles and handling
  large format tiles proved very daunting task. Thanks to Padma who
  helped mix the glue,  keep time and scheduling the tasks
  I managed to lay the big formatted tiles over three weeks.
  When it comes to large format tiles, one should have a suction handle
  to be able to move the tile while glue is applied. The strong adhesion
  and large surface are would make it hard to maneuver without the suction handle
  you will in the pictures. Luckily my mom's shower handle came to the rescue.
  </p>
  <p>
  The tile cutter I chose was very nifty one made by Makita, battery operated
  and very portable. But its drawback is it takes long to make cuts.
  In additions cutting thick porcelain tile does use up diamond tools
  quickly. I had to buy additional discs to complete the job.

  The Makita tool very well made, battery operated and easy to handle.
  Its battery also lasts long time and you get twin pack with this tool
  which is about 300$. Only downside is that you have cant make the cut 
  in one go. Have to do it gradually over three times for 10mm thick 
  porcelain tile.

   Rough cuts can be done with angle grinder with diamond disc.
   Much faster, but lots of dust and some chipping. I used it
   sparingly. Also, a tool that you have to use with great care.

  Returning from India it took me a while to get back into

  my Dad's annual ceremony. I was not too keen on handling large glass
  panel all by myself and it can be tricky to get it right without
  help.
  <p>
  Planning and making waste connections kept me really awake for it
  requires me to work under the cramped conditions under my sub floor.
  The modern vanities are more geared for rear waste entry, and I have
  not planned for it. I had very tight clearances at the back of the vanity
  draws and lining up the waste to the existing line under the house
  proved difficult. After lot of struggle I managed to find a solution from
  my friend Dan. The 45deg angle PVC fitting came to the rescue.
  </p>
  <p> The waste connection to the shower was another night mare for
  it happened to be so close the cement stump, impeding rigid pipe
  access. Finally, thanks to the flexible waste connectors that are currently
  available I could make the connection easily </p>
